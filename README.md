# Feyncatt

### Description

An attempt at a robotic quadruped. At the current stage it's able to stand upright and do basic leg movements.

Schr√∂dinger was too obvious a name.

TODO:
 - attempt a basic walk cycle
 - reprint the feet to be more efficient
 - make the walk cycle more fluid
 - allow turning
 - allow environmental interaction

### Printed Parts Required

Can probably all be printed over about a week if you just do a couple parts a day, each part takes about an hour on standard settings.

 - 14 x servoMountV3
 - 8 x servoConnectorStraight
 - 4 x foot
 - 4 x servoConnectorTwist
 - 2 x bodyConnector
 - 1 x bodyBack
 - 1 x bodyFront
 - 1 x servoConnectorHead
 - 1 x servoConnectorNeck

### Build Instructions

- print everything
- figure out all the start/mid/end PWM values for the servos
- assemble the legs
- assemble the body
- assemble the head
- wire up the body
- connect the legs 
- wire up the legs
